# Renewal Ranch

## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive dashboard to estimate net greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farms using IPCC methodologies. The system optimizes feed solutions and balances emission reduction with cost efficiency, providing actionable insights for sustainable farm management practices. Interactive visualizations were created to monitor emissions, analyze feed scenarios, and track milk production.

## Technical Stack
- **Python**
- **Dash**
- **Plotly**
- **Seaborn**
- **Excel**

## Key Features
- Calculates greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farms using IPCC methodologies.
- Applies SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming) to optimize feed solutions for emission reduction and cost-efficiency.
- Utilizes Python Dash, Plotly, and Seaborn for dynamic charts on emissions, feed scenarios, and milk production.
- Translates complex data into actionable recommendations for sustainable practices.
- Covers data ingestion, processing, visualization, and recommendation generation.

## Results & Impact
- Enabled farmers to optimize feed solutions, reducing emissions while maintaining cost efficiency.
- Contributed to sustainable farm management by offering actionable recommendations based on complex environmental data.
